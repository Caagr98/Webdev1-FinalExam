		<h1>The invention of the Web</h1>
		<h2>The Beginning</h2>
		<p>In the beginning, there was nothing.</p>
		<p>Well, since it wasn't the <em>absolute</em> beginning, there was a world and all that, but nothing that matters.</p>
		<p>Getting bored with this nothing, man created computers. And man saw that it was good.</p>
		<p>Man was wrong, of course; those computers were nothing remarkable with today's standards.</p>
		<p>However, at the time, today's standards were still the future, and with <em>that</em> today's standards, it was good.</p>
		<p>That's beside the point though.</p>
		<p>The computer was a neat invention, but then man decided to create the Internet, too.</p>
		<h2>The W3</h2>
		<p>After the beginning, it was fairly common to write scientific articles on computers,
			usually with various (nowadays primitive) markup languages with support for things like headings and italics.</p>
		<p>CERN, for example, used a language called SGMLguid.</p>
		<p>This language supported most things needed at the moment, but there was no way to link between
			different articles except simply saying the name and telling the reader to find it himself.</p>
		<p>Therefore, in 1990, a CERN worker named Tim Berners-Lee (TimBL) invented the World Wide Web (originally abbreviated W3, now WWW),
			along with HTML and HTTP to implement it; the major feature of HyperText compared to other markup languages was the ability to HyperLink to other articles, creating a Web of documents.</p>
		<p>The first recorded HTML document
			<a href="http://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/Link.html">[1]</a>
			is clearly identifiable as HTML, but the structure is completely different - instead of a tree, it appears to use a linear structure. Other early HTML documents
			<a href="http://www.w3.org/History/1992/nfs_dxcern_mirror/rpc/doc/User/Bibliography.html">[2]</a>
			<a href="http://www.w3.org/History/1992/nfs_dxcern_mirror/rpc/doc/User/M68kStandAlone.html">[3]</a>
			also display this behavior, along with some non-standard tag names, most of which come from the previously mentioned SGMLguid.</p>
		<p>The list of supported tags for this ancient version of HTML is archived <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Tags.html">here</a>.
			Interestingly, TimBL expressed dissatisfaction at the &lt;H{1..6}&gt; tags, instead wanting a nested &lt;SECTION&gt; tag containing a generic &lt;H&gt; tag -
			one of which was added about 20 years later, while the other still doesn't exist.</p>
		<h2>Adoption</h2>
		<p>A few important points about the Web are that it's <em>free</em> and <em>decentralized</em>. Being free meant that anyone could use it for anything they want,
			and being decentralized means that there isn't one single server hosting the entire Web, which would have meant that the maintainer of that server would have
			total control over every website.</p>
		<p>In January '93, there were about fifty web servers worldwide. By October the same year, there were over five hundred.</p>
		<p>Early browsers include the original unnamed browser for the NeXT operating system, some unknown browser called Erwise and ViolaWWW,
			and the console-based Lynx (which still exists today, but it doesn't have very many users).</p>
		<p>However, the browser that made the Web what it is today is Mosaic. Featuring an intuitive UI, a Windows version, and support for inline images (&lt;img&gt; tags),
			it quickly got popular. The same company developed another browser, known as Netscape Navigator, while Mosaic was licensed to Microsoft and made into Internet Explorer.</p>
