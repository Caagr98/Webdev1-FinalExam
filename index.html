			<h1>The Invention of the Web</h1>
			<h2>The Beginning</h2>
			<p>In the beginning, there was nothing.</p>
			<p>Well, since it wasn't the <em>absolute</em> beginning, there was a world and all that, but nothing that matters.</p>
			<p>Getting bored with this nothing, man created computers. And man saw that it was good.</p>
			<p>Man was wrong, of course; those computers were nothing remarkable with today's standards.</p>
			<p>However, at the time, today's standards were still the future, and with <em>that</em> today's standards, it was good.</p>
			<p>That's beside the point though.</p>
			<p>The computer was a neat invention, but then man decided to create the Internet, too.</p>
			<h2>The W3</h2>
			<p>After the beginning, it was fairly common to write scientific articles on computers, usually with various (nowadays primitive) markup languages with support for things like headings and italics.</p>
			<p>CERN, for example, used a language called SGMLguid.</p>
			<p>This language supported most things needed at the moment, but there was no way to link between different articles except simply saying the name and telling the reader to find it himself.</p>
			<p>Therefore, in 1990, a CERN worker named Tim Berners-Lee (TimBL) invented the World Wide Web (originally abbreviated W3, now WWW), along with HTML and HTTP to implement it; the major feature of HyperText compared to other markup languages was the ability to HyperLink to other articles, creating a Web of documents.</p>
			<p>The first recorded HTML document<a class=ref href="http://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/Link.html">[1]</a> is clearly identifiable as HTML, but the structure is completely different - instead of a tree, it appears to use a linear structure. Other early HTML documents<a class=ref href="http://www.w3.org/History/1992/nfs_dxcern_mirror/rpc/doc/User/Bibliography.html">[2]</a><a class=ref href="http://www.w3.org/History/1992/nfs_dxcern_mirror/rpc/doc/User/M68kStandAlone.html">[3]</a> also display this behavior, along with some non-standard tag names, most of which come from the previously mentioned SGMLguid.</p>
			<p>The list of supported tags for this ancient version of HTML is archived <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Tags.html">here</a>.  Interestingly, TimBL expressed dissatisfaction at the <span class=tag>&lt;H{1..6}&gt;</span> tags, instead wanting a nested <span class=tag>&lt;SECTION&gt;</span> tag containing a generic <span class=tag>&lt;H&gt;</span> tag - one of which was added about 20 years later, while the other still doesn't exist.</p>
			<h2>Adoption</h2>
			<p>A few important points about the Web are that it's <em>free</em> and <em>decentralized</em>. Being free meant that anyone could use it for anything they want, and being decentralized means that there isn't one single server hosting the entire Web, which would have meant that the maintainer of that server would have total control over every website.</p>
			<p>In January '93, there were about fifty web servers worldwide. By October the same year, there were over five hundred.</p>
			<p>Early browsers include the original unnamed browser for the NeXT operating system, some (nowadays rather unknown) browsers called Erwise and ViolaWWW, and the console-based Lynx (which still exists today, but it doesn't have very many users).</p>
			<p>However, the browser that made the Web what it is today is Mosaic. Featuring an intuitive UI, a Windows version, and support for inline images (<span class=tag>&lt;img&gt;</span> tags), it quickly got popular.</p>
			<h1>The Browser Wars</h1>
			<h2>Browsers</h2>
			<p>The Mosaic browser was licensed to multiple companies, who created their own forks, including AirMosaic and Spyglass Mosaic. The creator of the original Mosaic founded a company, Mosaic Communications Corporation, and created Mosaic Netscape.</p>
			<p>To avoid legal trouble, Mosaic Communications Corporation was renamed to Netscape Communications Corporation (NCC), and the browser was renamed to Netscape Navigator, usually known as Netscape.</p>
			<p>Being both fast, free (for non-commercial use), and easy to use, Netscape Navigator dominated the World Wide Web by 1995.</p>
			<p>In 1995, Internet Explorer 1.0 was released, reaching feature parity with version 3.0 in 1996.</p>
			<p>Of course, it also had a bunch of features not found in Netscape, including the (nowadays much hated) <span class="blink tag">&lt;blink&gt;</span> and <span class="marqee tag"><span>&lt;marqee&gt;</span></span> tags.</p>
			<p>In 1996, IE version 4 was released. Due to being preinstalled on all Windows computers - a vast majority - IE's market share quickly grew.</p>
			<p>While both NN and IE used HTML, they had some differences (for example the aforementioned blink and marqee tags). This led to some websites to add logos saying "This website works best in Netscape" or similar, which meant that to have the optimal browsing experience, you'd have to switch between the two browsers depending on what website you were visiting - which is hardly optimal.</p>
			<p>To resolve this, it was agreed that websites should try to follow the standards set by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</p>
			<h2>War</h2>
			<p>Microsoft had two major advantages over NCC:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>NCC had no major products other than Netscape. Microsoft had, among other things, Windows. This meant Microsoft had far superior income, and could put more money into their browser, and provide it for free to <em>all</em> users, not only non-commercial users.</li>
				<li>IE was bundled with every copy of Windows, which had a 90% market share. Most users were also rather new to the internet, and didn't even know that there were any other browsers.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In 2002, IE had 96% market share: far more than Netscape ever had.</p>
			<p>Thus ended the First Browser War.</p>
			<p>After being defeated by IE, Netscape open-sourced their browser, and later entrusted it to the Mozilla Foundation.</p>
			<p>In 2003, Microsoft discontinued IE for Mac. A few months later, with the release of OSX 10.3, Apple released the Safari browser, along with the WebKit rendering engine, which was later ported to Windows in 2007.</p>
			<p>After a few years, and about as many name changes (from Phoenix to Firebird to Firefox), Mozilla Firefox 1.0 was released in 2004, bringing numerous new features (many of them, for example a separate seach bar, copied from Opera).</p>
			<p>In 2006, Microsoft released IE7, which contained tabs, a separate search bar, and better standards support - all of which had existed in Firefox and Opera for a long time.</p>
			<p>Google released Google Chrome, also based on WebKit, in 2008. After releasing Mac and Linux versions, its market share grew rapidly.</p>
			<p>In mid-2010, IE dropped below 50% market share for the first time since its creation, mainly due to the fast growth of Chrome.</p>
			<p>Some sources claim that by mid-2012, Chrome had surpassed IE in popularity, though other sources disagree.</p>
