		<h1>The Browser Wars and Dot-Com Boom</h1>
		<h2>Browsers</h2>
		<p>The Mosaic browser was licensed to multiple companies, who created their own forks, including AirMosaic and Spyglass Mosaic. The creator of the original Mosaic
			founded a company, Mosaic Communications Corporation, and created Mosaic Netscape.</p>
		<p>To avoid legal trouble, Mosaic Communications Corporation was renamed to Netscape Communications Corporation (NCC), and the browser
			was renamed to Netscape Navigator, usually known as Netscape.</p>
		<p>Being both fast, free (for non-commercial use), and easy to use, Netscape Navigator dominated the World Wide Web by 1995.</p>
		<p>In 1995, Internet Explorer 1.0 was released, reaching feature parity with version 3.0 in 1996.</p>
		<p>Of course, it also had a bunch of features not found in Netscape, including the (nowadays much hated) <span class=blink>&lt;blink&gt></span> and
			<span class=marqee>&lt;marqee&gt;</span> tags.</p>
		<p>In 1996, IE version 4 was released. Due to being preinstalled on all Windows computers - a vast majority - IE's market share quickly grew.</p>
		<p>While both NN and IE used HTML, they had some differences (for example the aforementioned blink and marqee tags). This led to some websites to add logos
			saying "This website works best in Netscape" or similar, which meant that to have the optimal browsing experience, you'd have to switch between the two browsers
			depending on what website you were visiting - which is hardly optimal.</p>
		<p>To resolve this, it was agreed that websites should try to follow the standards set by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</p>
		<h2>War</h2>
		<p>Microsoft had two major advantages over NCC:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>NCC had no major products other than Netscape. Microsoft had, among other things, Windows. This meant Microsoft had far superior income,
				and could put more money into their browser, and provide it for free to <em>all</em> users, not only non-commercial users.</li>
			<li>IE was bundled with every copy of Windows, which had a 90% market share. Most users were also rather new to the internet, and didn't know
				that there even were any other browsers.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In 2002, IE had 96% market share: far more than Netscape ever had.</p>
